You can use [jekyll][jekyll] to build your own static **web site for every github repository**.
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2021-05-19-jekyll-logo.png">
    </div>
</div>
<br/>
It is a powerfull tool enabling to combine [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template language, markdown and html. 
Github repository is by default built from a branch called `gh-pages`, the easiest is to follow this convention (you can tweak this in your repository under _Settings > Pages > Source_).

# Installation

For all OS set the folder (otherwise you will risk rights issues) ```export BUNDLE_PATH=~/.gems```
You can refer to [jekyll with bundler][jekyll with bundler] for further details.

## a. Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full
sudo apt install bundler
```

You can check ruby is correctly installed
```bash
$ruby --version
$ruby 3.0.2p107 (2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
```

## b. MacOS
You need to install `ruby` (which will include `bundler`). You can do so using [homebrew][homebrew]
```bash
brew install ruby@2.7
```
NB: it did not work for me with latest Ruby 3.x but worked like a charm with 2.7

Add ruby and its gems to your path
```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/username/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.7:$PATH"' >> /Users/username/.bash_profile
```
refresh your environment
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```
## c. Fedora
You can follow instructions from https://gainanov.pro/eng-blog/linux/installing-jekyll-fedora/
```bash
sudo dnf install ImageMagick
```

# Scaffolding

Go to the directory you want to create your repository website in
```bash
mkdir <your_new_repo_folder> && cd <your_new_repo_folder>
bundle init
sudo bundler add jekyll
bundler exec jekyll new --force --skip-bundle .
```

# Test
You can run locally your website and adjust what's needed
```bash
bundler install
bundler exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
It will print the url you can access to visualise your site.

# Look and Feel
To go beyond this simple introduction you may want to leverage existing [templates][jekyll-templates], do not hesitate to have a look pick one or create your own.


# Troubleshooting
- the site does not refresh once pushed on ghithub
    - you can check under you repository *Settings > Pages*
    If everything went well you should see below message, otherwise you may get a hint of the issue
    <div class="row mt-3">
        <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
            <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2021-05-19-jekyll-github.png">
        </div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    - also if you notice your site is not refreshing, you can try to push an empty commit to force a refresh 

    ```bash
    git commit -m 'rebuild pages' --allow-empty
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```

- install ImageMagick for [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme

```bash
sudo apt install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickwand-dev
```
